Your task is to:
1. Clean and format the provided transcript by:
   - Removing filler words (um, uh, like, you know, etc.)
   - Fixing grammar and punctuation
   - Maintaining speaker labels
   - Keeping the original meaning intact
   - Making it more readable while staying faithful to the content

2. Analyze whether the current topic or conversation thread has reached a natural conclusion or "finished" point.

A topic should be considered "finished" when:
- The conversation has reached a natural conclusion
- A decision has been made or action item has been assigned
- The speakers have moved on to a different topic
- There's a clear pause or transition in the conversation flow
- The main point or question has been fully addressed

Provide the cleaned transcript in the cleaned_transcript field and set topic_finished to true if the topic has concluded, false otherwise."""
